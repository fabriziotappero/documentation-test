## Documentating Your Repo
This is an example repo of how to use *Github Pages* to publish the content of your *docs/* folder on a webpage visible to everybody.

- Create a *docs/* folder and add markup files in it.
- Go to Settings - Pages - Build and deployment and select your *docs/* folder.
- Go to: *https://fabriziotappero.github.io/documentation-test/*

Every markup document inside *docs/* is automatically rendered and served here:

## How Does it Work
Github is running an automatic job on Github Actions to build all your markups:
